  <h2>From Spreadsheets to Code</h2>
  <h3>I'm a developer.</h3>
  <h3>It just took me ten years to realize that.  It's funny how the signs were there when I look back at my previous career as a pricing analyst.  When I got tired of doing redundant tasks, I wrote macros in Excel.  When I needed data, I wrote SAS and SQL queries to get them myself.  I thoroughly enjoyed projects where I worked with consultants to deploy a new system.</h3>
  <h3>So, I made the difficult decision to leave my job and pursue my dream at <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>.  Guess what?  Best decision I ever made (after marrying my wonderful wife of course).</h3>

  <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
  
  <h3>Dreams</h3>
  <h5>It's funny how our priorities change over time.  I used to think it was important to just climb the corporate ladder and make money.  Now, I realize it's not worth it if the job stops being fulfilling.  From now on, I'm going to work by doing what I love.</h5>

  <h3>Family</h3>
  <h5>My family is important to me.  Without their support, I would not have been able to make my career changing decision.  I am grateful for the love of my parents, sister, and wife.</h5>

  <h3>Geek Cred</h3>
  <h5>Yes, it is cliche.  However, I am an avid comic-book reader and video game player.  My wife is thankful I buy digital comics now instead of cluttering the house with physical copies.</h5>
